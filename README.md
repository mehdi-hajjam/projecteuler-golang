This folder is a personal effort through ProjectEuler.net archive problems with the language golang.
To conform with the philosophy of this website, please make sure you solve the problems **on your own** before looking at my own solution to the problem.

Problems 1 to 22 included, and problem 67 are in this repository.

###### About Project Euler
[projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a neat way to find interesting mathematical problems, while filtering on efficient solutions with the constraint of convergence under a minute on a regular computer. Please do not make easily accessible solutions to the most recent problems.

###### About golang
"Go or Golang is a programming language created at Google, by Google developers and other programmers. This programming language is free and open source and currently being maintained by Google. One of the founding member of Go is Ken Thompson who is best known for his work in Unix operating system development. Go compiler was initially written in C but now, it is written in Go itself, making it self hosted."
